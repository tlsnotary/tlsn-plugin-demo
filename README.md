# [TLSNotary Plugin Demo](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn-plugin-demo#tlsn-plugin-demo)

Welcome to the **TLSNotary Plugin Demo**! This demo showcases how TLSNotary can be used to verify private user data in web applications.

In this demo, you'll prove that you own a Twitter account to the web server. The website will verify your proof and, as a reward, you'll receive a POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) token â€” while stocks last!
